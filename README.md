4.2-Router
==========

Overrides/Classes to allow Router in Ext JS 4.2

Router stuff
============

There are the actual three classes (Queue, Route and Router) in the Ux/app/route/ directory.

Overrides
=========

There are a few overrides that make things work together. These overrides will not be needed in the official release with the Router in it.

 - **overrides/Class.js** This class is an override to get the config system to work in a controller by prefixing '_' on the actual property. Otherwise the control config would overwrite the control method breaking everything.
 - **overrides/app/Application.js** This override really boots off the initial hash. So for direct linking (someone starting the app with a hash), this will detect this and handle it.
 - **overrides/app/Controller.js** This override is what will connect the routes configured on the controllers to the Router and have the methods executed.
 - **overrides/util/History.js** There were some bugs that I had found in the History class, this override fixes these issues.

A reminder, these overrides will not be needed in the official release that contains the Router.

App
===

This app was generated by Cmd and has an example of the routes and refs. This is a simple app, remember you can use the control and listen configs in the config object in the controller.
